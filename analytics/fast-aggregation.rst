Kicking off quick aggregation job has three steps:
---------------------------------------------------
(Jason):

1. Make sure that Analytics is running.
2. reset yesterday's aggregation status ('reporting' database)::

    update meta_agg_daily
    set status = 'UNRUN'
    where date_key = to_days(now()) - 1;

 - If you don't have a record, you can insert one::

    insert into meta_agg_daily (date_key)
    values (to_days(now()) - 1);

3. Kick off the aggregation job ('reporting' database)::

    update QRTZ_TRIGGERS
    set next_run_time = now()
    where trigger_name = "AggregateDataTrigger";


Assumptions:
--------------

* There are raw_v2_* tables containing yesterday's data.
* The are no records in meta_batch where batch_status is not COMPLETED or
  FAILED with a timestamp less than today.  The aggregation won't run if it
  finds incomplete batches.
